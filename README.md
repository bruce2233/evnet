`Evnet` is event-driven net framework with high performance deriving from gnet and evio. It supports  [epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EpollNetty ) syscall in Linux. If it's useful to you, Please STAR it!

# âœ¨ Features

- [x] Supporting an event-driven mechanism: epoll on Linux.
- [ ] Supporting multiple protocols/IPC mechanism: TCP, UDP and Unix Domain Socket.
- [x] Efficient memory buffer and zero copy.
- [ ] Supporting multiple load-balancing algorithms: Round-Robin, Source-Addr-Hash and Least-Connections
- [ ] Implementation of gnet Client

# ðŸŽ¬ Getting started
```powershell 
go get github.com/bruce2233/evnet
```

```go
import "github.com/bruce2233/evnet"

type MyHandler struct {
	BuiltinEventHandler
}

func (mh MyHandler) OnConn(c Conn) error{
	p, err := c.Next(-1)
    if err!=nil{
        return evnet.ErrClose
    }
    c.AsyncWrite(p, func(c Conn){
        c.Close()
    })
}

//main.go
func main() {
	readHandler := MyHandler{BuiltinEventHandler{}}
	Run(readHandler, "tcp://127.0.0.1:9000")
}
```
